# hackify

Hackify is a music library powered by the Spotify API. The user will search for an artist's name. When an artist's link is clicked the corresponding artist's albums will appear. Each album's name, popularity and album cover is shown with the albums tracks.

The app is made from scratch, no templates. The front end uses bootstrap with basic html and css. The backend uses Nodejs with the npm request module for the API requests. The hardest part of creating this app was doing it without promises (javascript). Having to almost make 1 request for each piece of album data and keeping track of it all asynchronously was a fun challenge. The link to the Github repo is here GithubRepo and the actual app is deployed using Heroku Hackify. Hope you like it!
